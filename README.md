🌿 Plant Disease Identifier
A deep learning web app that identifies plant diseases from leaf images. Upload a photo of a leaf and the model instantly diagnoses the disease with a confidence score and top 3 predictions.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This is a personal learning project built to practice deep learning and web development. The model is not 100% accurate and should not be used for professional or agricultural decisions.
